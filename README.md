# Database-Array-Practice

This is just a practice javascript file to showcase and get more familiar with new javascript concepts I had recently learned.
I also learned Git and GitHub through the unix command line interace so this tests these new skills as well.

That is why there is only 1 version because I hadn't learned Git version control until after I had completed this application.
